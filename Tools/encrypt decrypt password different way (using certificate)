To securely store credentials at rest, the built-in Protect-CmsMessage and Unprotect-CmsMessage cmdlets can be used with PowerShell 5 and later. Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) cmdlets leverage certificate-based encryption to store data securely. This requires you to have the public key of the RSA document encryption certificate of your recipientâ€”which might be you as well. In order to decrypt a message encrypted to you, you will need access to your private key, as seen in the following code sample:
# Add a new self-signed certificate for testing
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject SomeRecipient -KeyUsage KeyEncipherment -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Type DocumentEncryptionCert

# Use the certificate to encrypt a message (public key of recipient required)
Protect-CmsMessage -to CN=SomeRecipient -Content "Securable goes here" | Out-File .\EncryptedContent.txt

# Decrypt the message on another system (private key required)
Unprotect-CmsMessage -Content (Get-Content .\EncryptedContent.txt -Raw)
